        <div class="text">
          The environment game was originally intended to be released to elementary schools on Earth day in order to teach young students about the harmful effects of littering, 
          as well as other nature themes. Originally  designed to be the main project for our club, it was divided up among all of us in order to complete it by Earth Day. Despite 
          not finishing it in time, the game is still considered a success.

        <div class="text">
          The Recyclables AI is a tensorflow model that classifies different trash that appears in an image. There's a 12 catagory and 6 catagory model.
          These models use a combination of transfer learning, deep neural nets, and convolutional neural nets to classify an image. There are 3
          versions with varing degrees of accuracy, but all of them perform at 75% or better accuracy. This was mostly a test to see how neural learning
          works in depth and areas where it should and shouldn't be used. All of the models are published as Jupyter notebooks designed to work with Google Colab.

        <div class="text">
          The Hangman Game is a replica of the classic game Hangman. It was originally played on a paper and pencil but was then digitalized into a video game. The basic idea of Hangman
          is to try and guess a word that the opponent had though of with the least amount of mistakes - too many mistakes and you lose. The game was made by four members of the Natck High 
          Coding Club. It can be downloaded and played on the Natick High School Coding Club Github page - or click the blue heading above.

        <div class="text">
          This was the first project we created. The program is given an array
          of integers and is then tasked with determining whether to output
          "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or nothing at all.

        <h2><a href="#" target="_blank">Prime Number Finder</a></h2>
        <div class="text">
          The prime number finder was a project that was worked on for a couple of coding club meetings, a few weeks after we officially started meetings for this year. 
          This project was worked on by a small group of students within the club, and helped to reinforce common staples of programming. The goal of this project was to 
          be able to enter a range of two numbers and get an output of all of the prime numbers within that range. This required us to use if and else statements, loops, 
          variables and numerical operators. We also needed to be able to receive user input and then output our answer. We had a few different versions of this, and 
          eventually we fixed all of the bugs and were able to settle on a format that we all liked. Overall, this project not only helped us to strengthen our familiarity 
          with programming. It also helped us to learn how to fix bugs, make design choices and work efficiently as a team. If you would like to try out this project for yourself,

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/NHS-CS-Club/Project-E.Z">Minecraft Helper Mod (aka. ProjectEZ)</a></h2>
        <div class="text">
          This is a Minecraft Fabric mod which has a purpose of improving the quality of life
          of the player using the mod, with mods such as fullbright, potion effects display,
          light level visualizer and more. The github release can be found here:
          <a href="https://github.com/NHS-CS-Club/Project-E.Z/releases/tag/1.0.0">Release 1.0.0</a>.
          It can be installed by putting it into your mods folder and then running Minecraft with Fabric for 1.16.5 installed.
          This was primarily created by two members of the club. The group used IntelliJ and
          the fabric base project in order to start their mod, and from there created several
          custom systems for player to use. The full code is available on github.
